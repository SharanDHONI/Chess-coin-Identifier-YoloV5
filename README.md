# Chess-coin-Identifier using YoloV5(m)
I initially tried to use the yolov5s and got decent results. (as the model had some cases of False Negatives for white rook). 
Then tried the yoloV5m and got much better results. This can be used while playing chess to notify the player regarding a wrong move based on the coins characteristics
